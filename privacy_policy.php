    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>Last updated August 2022
        <br><br>
        Welcome to WYDRN.com (the "Site"), provided by WYDRN LLC, and its affiliates, subsidiaries, parent company and other related companies ("Us", "We", or "WYDRN"). This WYDRN.com Privacy Policy ("Policy") describes the information we gather from you when you use the Site, mobile applications, and related services (together, the "Services") and how we use, process, and disclose that information. We may add to this Policy with other notices. We may also post additional privacy statements for some portions of the Services. By submitting personal information through our Services, you expressly consent to the transfer of your personal data to our servers in the U.S. for our collection, use, and disclosure in accordance with this Policy.
    </p>
    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>When you create an account and use our Service, we collect the following types of information from you:
        <br><br>
        1. Name;<br>
        2. Contact information such as your email address and phone number;<br>
        3. Any other information, such as reviews, content, and bio, you provide us.<br>
        If you create an account using, or otherwise connect your account to, a social networking services account (e.g. Twitter or Facebook), we may also collect information provided to us by such social networking service including for example your: name; email address; birthday; geographic location; interests; profile picture; gender; networks; user ID; list of friends; and any information you have made public on such social networking account.
        <br><br>
        We automatically collect information about how you use our services, for example, pages you have viewed. We also collect certain technical information about your device including your Internet protocol address, geo-location information, your browser type, language and identifying information, your operating system and application version, device types, device model and manufacturer, device identifiers, and your device operating system type and version.
        <br><br>
        We also use cookies, Web beacons, and URL information to gather information regarding the date and time of your visit and the information for which you searched and which you viewed. Cookies are small pieces of information that a website sends to your computer's hard drive while you are viewing a website. We may use both session cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent cookies (which usually stay on your computer until you delete them) to provide you with a more personal and interactive experience on our Site. Web beacons are digital images that are used to log information on the Services or in our emails. We use Web beacons to manage cookies, count visits, and to learn what marketing works and what does not. We also use Web beacons to tell if you open or act on our emails.
        <br><br>
        Others, including third party analytics service providers and advertising partners may also collect personally identifiable information about your online activities over time and across different Web sites when you use our Services, including as described in this Privacy Policy. This Policy does not apply to and we are not responsible for those other parties. Third party analytics services may use cookies and web beacons through our Site (for example Google Analytics) to provide us with information about how you use and interact with our Site. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of these third parties to learn about your choices about information they collect from you.

        <br><br>
        The Services may also provide you with the option to share certain information from your WYDRN account with social networking services like Facebook, Google, or Twitter. We are not responsible for the use or re-sharing by others of any of your information once it is made public. If you do not want your information to be made public, you should not use the WYDRN Services in this manner and/or you should adjust your privacy settings on the applicable social networking service accordingly.

If you choose to remove cookies or reject cookies, this could affect certain features or services of our Site. To opt-out of Google Analytics web tracking for certain browsers, you can download Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on. You may opt out of other cookies that may be present on the Site by following the directions on Google's opt-out page. However, while we and others give you choices as described in this policy, there are many ways in which Web browser signals and other similar mechanisms can indicate your choice to disable tracking, and our Site may not be aware of or honor every mechanism.
